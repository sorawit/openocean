# OpenOcean

Ocean is not truly open if it still has high fee and not community driven. OpenOcean is the place
where you can offer or bid your NFTs freely, without fee. You always maintain the custody of
your NFT until the moment it's sold. The core marketplace code has less than 100 lines. Read it yourself!
